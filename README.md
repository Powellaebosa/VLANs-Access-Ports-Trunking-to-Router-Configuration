# VLANs-Access-Ports-Trunking-to-Router-Configuration
In this lab walkthrough, I demonstrate how to design and configure a segmented network using VLANs for Management, Data, and Voice traffic in Cisco Packet Tracer. This project showcases the foundational concepts and practical implementation of VLANs, access port assignments, voice QoS, and trunking to the router for Inter-VLAN routing.
